# Semiconductor--packaging-
This GitHub repository documents the Semiconductor Packaging - Fundamentals of Design and Testing 10-days Workshop offered by VSD Corp. Pvt. Ltd. attended from 15-27 Aug. 2025. 
The workshop offers a full-pipeline understanding of the semiconductor packaging process, starting from the fundamentals and evolution of packaging to advanced 2.5D/3D architectures. We gain insights into advanced interconnect technologies, RDLs & interposers,  assembly processes, package reliability analysis, and also get to perform hands-on thermal simulations, package design and modeling using ANSYS tools.

## 1 - Packaging Evolution: From Basics to 3D Integration
Semiconductor packaging is a process of enclosing a fabricated semiconductor chip(die) in a protective case that:
1. Protect it from the physical damage.
2. Provides electrical connections between the microscopic circuits on the chip and the real world .
3. Manages heat generated by the chip during operation.
**WHY IS IT NEEDED?**
Bare silicon dies are fragile and cannot be directly used in the devices .
1. ##Protection of chip - from physical damage ,moisture,dustand communication. 
2. ##Electrical connections -done between the microscopic bonding pads on the chip and the larger pins or the balls used to connect to a circuit board.
3.## Heat dissipation - to prevent the overheating during operation.
4. ##Mechanical support - provides a stable from for assembly into devices.
5. ##Standardization - definesthe sizer,pin count,and the layout for the compatibility.
