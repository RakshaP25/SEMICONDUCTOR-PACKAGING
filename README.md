## 1 - Packaging Evolution: From Basics to 3D Integration
Semiconductor packaging is a process of enclosing a fabricated semiconductor chip(die) in a protective case that:
1. Protect it from the physical damage.
2. Provides electrical connections between the microscopic circuits on the chip and the real world .
3. Manages heat generated by the chip during operation.
**WHY IS IT NEEDED?**
Bare silicon dies are fragile and cannot be directly used in the devices .
1. Protection of chip - from physical damage ,moisture,dustand communication. 
2. Electrical connections -done between the microscopic bonding pads on the chip and the larger pins or the balls used to connect to a circuit board.
3. Heat dissipation - to prevent the overheating during operation.
4. Mechanical support - provides a stable from for assembly into devices.
5. Standardization - definesthe sizer,pin count,and the layout for the compatibility.
The key Functions of semiconductor package are:
  1. **Protection** from external environmental (physical/ mechanical damage, humidity, corrosion/ contaminants & chemical damage and ESD)
  2. **Electrical connectivity** between the die and the external environment via leads (pins, balls or lands)
  3. **Mechanical support and connection** of the die to the system
  4. **Thermal dissipation** to conduct heat away from the die

### 1.1 - Introduction To Semiconductor Packaging And Industry Overview
<br>
The semiconductor industry is the backbone of modern technology‚Äîpowering everything from smartphones and laptops to cars and satellites.The semiconductor manufacturing process consists of the front-end process which refers to the wafer manufacturing and the back-end process which consists of packaging and testing. (Even the wafer manufacturing process is split into a front-end and back-end process - with the front-end typically consisting of the CMOS-making process, and the back-end comprising the metal wiring formation process that comes after the CMOS is made.)

üìà** Industry Highlights:**
Global Market Size: Over $600 billion annually and growing.
Key Players: Intel, TSMC, Samsung, Qualcomm, NVIDIA, AMD.
Major Segments:
Design: Creating chip architecture (e.g., ARM, AMD).
Fabrication: Manufacturing chips (e.g., TSMC, GlobalFoundries).
Packaging & Testing: Final assembly and quality checks.
Equipment & Materials: Tools and chemicals used in production.
üåê **Trends Shaping the Industry:**
AI & Machine Learning: Driving demand for high-performance chips.

*"The first phase of the packaging and testing process is wafer testing. Afterwards, packages are made in the packaging process and followed by the package test stage."*  
_Ref:_ [_SK Hynix Newsroom: Semiconductor Back-End Process Episode 3_](https://news.skhynix.com/semiconductor-back-end-process-episode-1-understanding-semiconductor-testing/) 
  - Companies like Nvidia, Qualcomm and Apple that only design semiconductors are called *‚Äúfabless.‚Äù*
  - Products designed by fabless companies are made into wafers, and the facilities that produce these wafers are called *‚Äúfoundries*.‚Äù
  -  Global companies with these facilities include TSMC, Global Foundries and UMC.
  - Then, there are companies that test and package products that were designed by fabless vendors and later, made into wafers at foundries. These are called *OSAT (Out-Sourced Assembly and Test)* which include companies such as ASE and Amkor.
  - Finally, there are the companies that do everything from design, wafer production, and packaging, to testing. These companies are called *IDMs (Integrated Device Manufacturer)*.

### 1.3 - Evolving Package Architectures - From Single Chip To Multi-Chip Modules
#### 1.3.1 Classification and Anatomy of Semiconductor Packages
   The various types of semiconductor packages can be broadly grouped into two main categories:
  - Conventional Packages
  - Wafer-level packages

In conventional packaging, the wafer is sawed into dice before the chip is packaged, while wafer-level packaging involves a part, or all, of the packaging process being performed at the wafer level before proceeding with wafer sawing.
 :

üîÑ Evolution of Package Architectures
1. Single-Chip Packages
-Traditional packaging method.
-Contains one silicon die per package.
-Examples: DIP, QFP, BGA.
-Simple, cost-effective, but limited in performance and integration.

2. System-in-Package (SiP)
;Multiple dies (logic, memory, RF, etc.) integrated into a single package.
;Enables compact systems with diverse functionalities.
;Ideal for smartphones, wearables, and IoT devices.

3. Multi-Chip Modules (MCMs)
* Multiple dies placed side-by-side or stacked within one package.
* Dies may be from different process nodes or vendors.
* Offers high bandwidth, low latency, and better power efficiency.
* Used in high-performance computing, AI accelerators, and servers.

4. 2.5D Packaging
-Uses an interposer (usually silicon) to connect multiple dies.
-Improves signal integrity and power delivery.
-Common in GPUs and data center chips.

5. 3D Packaging
#Dies are stacked vertically using Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs).
#Saves space and boosts performance.
#Ideal for memory integration (e.g., HBM with processors).

**üß† Why This Evolution Matters**
. Performance Boost: Shorter interconnects mean faster communication.
. Power Efficiency: Reduced parasitics and better thermal management.
. Form Factor Reduction: Smaller, thinner devices.
. Heterogeneous Integration: Mix logic, memory, analog, and RF in one package. 
Depending on the medium of the package, packages can be further categorized into leadframe and laminate packages.

    - **DIP**: Traditional, with wirebonds and external leads
    - **QFN**: Compact with exposed thermal pads
    - **Leadframe CSP & QFP**: Scaled for density and SMT

  - **Laminate-Based Packages**
    - **PBGA**: Wirebonded to laminated substrates
    - **Flip Chip PBGA**: Superior signal and thermal performance
    - **LGA, FCCSP**: Common in modern devices

  - **Advanced Substrates**
    - **2D**: Dies placed side-by-side on the same substrate
    - **2.1D**: Adds RDL for better routing
    - **2.3D**: Uses organic interposers
    - **2.5D**: Silicon interposer for high-speed interconnects (e.g.: CoWoS)

    - Multi-die integration
    - System-in-Package (SiP)

Advantages:
    - Allows larger bump pitch for finer pad layouts
    - Reduces package size and thickness
    - Enables multi-chip placement and interconnect on a single substrate

#### 1.4.2 - Interposers
An interposer is a passive or active layer inserted between the die and the substrate, acting as an intermediate routing interface. It enables dense signal routing, power delivery, and die-to-die interconnect.

  - Types: Silicon, Organic, Glass

  -  Functions:Enables fan-out packaging and improves signal routing flexibility.
    - Routes signals between multiple dies (e.g., chiplets)

#### 2.1.2 - Introduction to a Package Manufacturing Unit (ATMP)
The ATMP process involves four core activities: Assembly, Testing, Marking, and Packaging.
The ATMPs could be OSATs (like ASE, Amkor, TATA etc.) or in-house ATMPs of IDMs (like Intel, Samsung, Micron) or Foundries (like TSMC, Samsung Foundry)

  1. Material Preparation and Storage
    - Incoming Wafers, Substrates, Leadframes, Mold Compounds, Consumables
  2. Processing Zone (Clean Room: ISO Class 6 & 7)
    - Major activities:
      - Die Attach & Mount
      - Wire or Flip-Chip Bonding
      - RDL formation
      - Encapsulation/ molding.
  3. Testing Area
    - Electrical Tests
    - Burn-in Test
    - Reliability chamber testing
  4. Warehouse
    - Storage of packaged ICs

### 2.2 - Wafer Pre-Preparation - Grinding And Dicing

This section explains the wafer preparation process inside an ISO Class 7 cleanroom of an ATMP (Assembly, Testing, Marking, and Packaging) facility. 

1. **Incoming Wafer Carrier**: Wafers arrive in a protective carrier that ensures they remain uncontaminated before entering the processing line.

2. **Wafer Inspection**: The wafers are visually and optically inspected for surface defects, contamination, or damage before further processing.

3. **Wafer Front Tape Lamination**: A protective tape is laminated on the front (device side) of the wafer to protect it during subsequent processes like grinding and dicing.

4. **Wafer Backside Grinding**: The wafer‚Äôs backside is ground using a rotating grinding wheel to reduce the wafer thickness from the ~700um to around 200um and enable better thermal performance and flexibility for final packaging.

5. **Tape Frame Mounting to Wafer Backside**: After grinding, the wafer is mounted on a ring frame using an adhesive tape. This stabilizes the wafer and keeps individual die in place during dicing.

6. **Two-step Wafer Dicing (Laser Grooving + Blade Dicing)**: <br>
6.1 **Laser Grooving**: Precision laser cuts grooves along scribe lines to weaken the wafer structure. <br>
6.2 **Blade Dicing**: A high-precision blade is then used to physically dice the wafer into individual dies or chips. <br>

### 2.3 - Wire Bond Packaging - Die Attach To Molding


1. **Die Attach**: The individual (die) is attached to a substrate or lead frame using epoxy. <br>
1.1 The Epoxy is dispensed onto the die in some pattern so as to avoid any voids during attach. (Pattern complexity vs. speed of processing trade-off) <br>
1.2 The die is picked up by the pick-up head, and <br>
1.3 Placed on the Die Attach Film (DAF) <br>

2. **Curing**: The die-attached unit is subjected to a heating process to cure the epoxy, ensuring a strong and stable bond between the die and the substrate.

3. **Wire Bonding**: Fine gold or aluminum wires are bonded between the die and the package substrate pads using thermal and ultrasonic energy. <br>
3.1 Formation of a ball bond using an EFO (Electronic Flame-Off) spark
3.2 Bonding the ball to the die pad (using pressure, vibration, heat)
3.3 Creating a wire loop
3.4 Forming a crescent bond on the substrate side

4. **Molding (Transfer Molding)**: A mold compound is injected to encapsulate the wire-bonded die, providing protection from environmental damage and mechanical stress. Resin flows uniformly to cover the entire chip.

5. **Marking (Laser)**: Laser marking is used to engrave identification codes, logos, or batch numbers on the molded package surface.

6. **Singulation (Dicing Blade)**: The molded wafer is cut into individual units (ICs) using a dicing blade. A thinner blade is typically used to minimize chipping and maximize precision.



### 2.4 - Flip Chip Assembly - Bump Formation And Underfill

Flip chip packaging enhances electrical performance and I/O density by mounting the die face-down on the substrate.

1. **Bump Formation on Silicon (Si)**:
1.1 Solder bumps are created on the die. <br>
1.2 The bumps are then reflowed to form strong electrical and mechanical connections. <br>

2. **Chip Flip and Placement**:
2.1 The chip is flipped upside down. <br>
2.3 Flux is dispensed on to the substrate to aid solder wetting. <br>
2.2 Solder balls are aligned with the substrate‚Äôs bond pads. <br>

3. **Solder Reflow**: The chip is heated so that the solder balls melt and bond with the substrate.

4. **Flux Cleansing**: The excess residual flux is removed using solvent spray to prevent corrosion.

5. **Underfill Dispensing**: Underfill material is applied to improve mechanical strength and thermal conductivity between the die and substrate.

6. **Underfill Cure**: Heated to cure the underfill.

7. **Molding**: A protective mold compound is applied.

8. **Marking**: Laser marking is done for identification (part number, lot, batch, date of manufacture etc.) and traceability.

9. **Ball Mounting and Reflow**: Solder balls are mounted on the substrate. A final reflow process ensures firm attachment of solder balls.
