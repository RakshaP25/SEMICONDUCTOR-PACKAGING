## 1 - Packaging Evolution: From Basics to 3D Integration
Semiconductor packaging is a process of enclosing a fabricated semiconductor chip(die) in a protective case that:
1. Protect it from the physical damage.
2. Provides electrical connections between the microscopic circuits on the chip and the real world .
3. Manages heat generated by the chip during operation.
**WHY IS IT NEEDED?**
Bare silicon dies are fragile and cannot be directly used in the devices .
1. Protection of chip - from physical damage ,moisture,dustand communication. 
2. Electrical connections -done between the microscopic bonding pads on the chip and the larger pins or the balls used to connect to a circuit board.
3. Heat dissipation - to prevent the overheating during operation.
4. Mechanical support - provides a stable from for assembly into devices.
5. Standardization - definesthe sizer,pin count,and the layout for the compatibility.

2.3D Packaging: Incorporates organic interposers to bridge dies, balancing performance and cost.

2.5D Packaging: Uses silicon interposers (e.g., CoWoS) to connect multiple dies with high-speed links, ideal for GPUs and data center chips.

### 1.4 - Interposers, RDLs And 2.5D/3D Packaging Approaches
#### 1.4.1 - Redistribution Layers (RDL)

 **RDLs (Redistribution Layers)**
Definition: Metal layers added to reroute I/O pads of a die to new locations.RDL (Redistribution Layer) is a metal layer added on top of a die or wafer to reroute the I/O pads to new locations. 
| ![Package_Interposers_RDLs](./docs/images/M1-L1-6.png) |
|:---|

*Applications of RDLs*
-RDLs are widely used in cutting-edge packaging formats where space, performance, and integration matter most:
-Fan-Out Wafer-Level Packaging (FOWLP): RDLs enable signal routing beyond the die edge, allowing for compact, high-performance packages.
-System-in-Package (SiP): Used to interconnect multiple dies (logic, memory, RF) within a single package.
-Panel-Level Packaging (PLP): RDLs support large-area manufacturing for cost-effective high-volume production.
-2.5D and 3D Integration: RDLs help connect the dies through the interposers or vertical stacking .

*Advantages of RDLs*
-RDLs offer several performance and design benefits that make them indispensable in modern IC packaging:
-**Enhanced Routing Flexibility**: Designers can relocate I/O pads to optimize signal paths and enable complex layouts.
-**Reduced Package Size**: By redistributing connections, RDLs allow for smaller, thinner packages‚Äîideal for mobile and wearable devices.
-**Improved Signal Integrity**: Shorter and more direct interconnects reduce latency and electromagnetic interference.
-**Higher Interconnect Density**: Supports more I/O connections in a limited footprint.
- **Better Thermal Management**: Optimized layouts help distribute heat more evenly across the package.
-**Cost Efficiency**: Enables advanced packaging without the need for expensive interposers in some cases.

#### 1.4.2 - Interposers
An interposer is a substrate layer placed between the silicon dies and the package substrate. It contains fine-pitch wiring, through-silicon vias (TSVs), and redistribution layers (RDLs) to reroute signals and power between components.
They‚Äôre typically made from:
-Silicon: High precision, ideal for high-speed applications.
-Organic materials: Cost-effective and easier to process.
-Glass: Emerging option with excellent electrical insulation and dimensional stability.
#### 1.4.3 - 2.5D/3D Integration

**Key Features**
-True Chip-Scale Packaging: The final package size closely matches the die dimensions.

-Fan-In WLCSP: Interconnects remain within the die footprint.

-Fan-Out WLCSP: Redistribution layers (RDLs) extend beyond the die, allowing more I/O connections.

-Integrated Process Flow: Combines wafer fab, packaging, testing, and burn-in at wafer level.

**Applications**
-Smartphones and wearables

-Sensors and MEMS devices

-RF and power management ICs

-High-performance memory modules.

**Finally Wafer-Level Packaging represents a major leap in semiconductor miniaturization and integration. By performing packaging at the wafer stage, WLP enables:*
-Smaller form factors for compact devices

-Improved electrical performance through shorter interconnects

-Lower cost and higher throughput in high-volume manufacturing

-Scalability for future heterogeneous integration and 3D stacking

-As demand grows for thinner, faster, and more power-efficient electronics, WLP continues to be a cornerstone of next-generation semiconductor design.

### 5.3 - Adding Die Attach Material and Bond Pads

  - **Step 5 : Create the Die Attach Material**
    
  - **Step 6 : Create Bond pads on Die and Substrate**
  - Draw a small rectangle and configure its size to to that of the die pad (0.2mm x 0.2mm). We will place the first Die Pad at the co-ordinates (0.2, 0.2, 0.2) so that it sits on top of the die and is at one of the edges.
  - Set the thickness to 5 microns (0.005mm)
  - Similarly, draw a small rectangle and configure its size to to that of the substrate bond pad (0.2mm x 0.2mm).
  - We will place this Substrate Bind Pad at the co-ordinates (0.2, -0.7, -0.1) so that it sits aligned to the Die bond pad created in the previous step, and also on top of the substrate.
  - Set the substrate bond pad thickness to 10 microns (0.010mm)
